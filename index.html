            She's been living in her uptown world
            I bet she's never had a backstreet guy
            I bet her momma never told her why
            I'm gonna try for an uptown girl
            She's been living in her white-bred world
            As long as anyone with hot blood can
            And now she's looking for a downtown man
            That's what I am
            And when she knows what
            She wants from her time
            And when she wakes up
            And makes up her mind
            She'll see I'm not so tough
            Just because
            I'm in love with an uptown girl
            You know I've seen her in her uptown world
            She's getting tired of her high-class toys

            But maybe someday when my ship comes in
            She'll understand what kind of guy I've been
            And then I'll win
            And when she's walking
            She's looking so fine
            And when she's talking

            She's been living in her uptown world
            I bet she's never had a backstreet guy
            I bet her momma never told her why
            I'm gonna try for an uptown girl
            She's been living in her white-bred world
            As long as anyone with hot blood can
            And now she's looking for a downtown man
            That's what I am
            And when she knows what

            She'll see I'm not so tough
            Just because
            I'm in love with an uptown girl
            You know I've seen her in her uptown world

            And then I'll win
            And when she's walking
            She's looking so fine
            And when she's talking
